# 📝 Simple To-Do List in Python

Welcome to my first ever personal project! 🎉 This simple **To-Do List** app is built using **Python** and the **PyCharm Community IDE**. It allows users to manage their tasks with ease. Check out the features below and get started!

## 🚀 Features
Users can perform the following tasks:
1. **Add a New Task** ✍️
2. **View Task List** 👀
3. **Mark a Task as Done** ✅ (which also removes it from the list or moves it to a `completed list`)
4. **Edit a Task** ✏️
5. **Exit the Program** 🚪

## 🖥️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ After Running the Program
Once you run the app, you will be presented with the main menu, where you can choose one of the services. See below for what the menu looks like:

### 2️⃣ Add a New Task
When you choose to add a task, you’ll be prompted for a task name. After entering the name, you will receive a confirmation message like this:

![Add Task](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06ee2cc-7c90-4488-b6dd-e6c5bddd1596)

---

### 3️⃣ View Task List
You can view your current tasks by selecting the option to see the task list. You'll be prompted to pick a specific list or cancel if you change your mind. Here’s what it looks like:

---

### 4️⃣ Mark a Task as Done
Once you have pending tasks, you can choose to mark one as done. You’ll be shown a list of all your current tasks, and you can select which task to mark as complete. Once marked, it will be either removed from the active list or moved to the "Completed" list.

---

### 5️⃣ Edit a Task ✏️
If you need to update the details of a task, you can select the "Edit Task" option. This will allow you to choose an existing task and modify its name or description. It's a great way to keep your tasks up to date and organized.

Here’s how the editing process looks:

### 6️⃣ Exit the Program
When you're done, simply choose to exit the program. You’ll be greeted with a farewell message like this:
